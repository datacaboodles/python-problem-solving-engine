# Python Problem Solving Engine

This repository documents my structured approach to solving Python problems with an interview-first mindset.

The focus is on clarity of thought, correctness, and the ability to explain logic clearly — not speed or clever tricks.

## How I Solve Problems

Every problem in this repository follows a fixed 9-step process:

1. Identify input, output, and data types  
2. State constraints and assumptions  
3. Explain decision logic in plain English  
4. List edge cases  
5. Break the problem into sub-parts  
6. Write pseudocode  
7. Dry-run with examples  
8. Write final Python code  
9. Validate logic and behavior

## Repository Structure

Each problem is stored in its own folder and includes:
- `problem.md` — full step-by-step reasoning
- `solution.py` — final clean Python implementation

## Why This Repository Exists

I am preparing for Python-focused roles in AI, data, and engineering teams.

This repository reflects how I think and approach problems, not just the final answers.
